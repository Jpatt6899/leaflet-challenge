Welcome to the United States Geological Survey Data! 



This html creates a visualized earthquake data set.

The app.js file creates mutiple functions that pull the data from USGS and populates a map to better vizual where earquackes are happening and how large they are. 

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. If the earthquakes has higher magnitudes the markers appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

The popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

The css file porivdes some additional styling for the page.


Enjoy!
